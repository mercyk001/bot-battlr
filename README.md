2. Enlist Bots: Add individual bots to your army by clicking on them
3. Release Bots: Remove bots from your army by clicking on them in the army section
4. Discharge Bots: Permanently remove bots from service by clicking the red "x" button

# Technolgies Used
1. React.js (npm start to get the app running in the browser.)
2. Bootstrap CSS for styling
3. JSON ( To start the JSON server in a separate terminal: json-server --watch db.json --port 8001, and to test the server: http://localhost:8001/bots )
